 
Pyenv: 


Python has multiple versions 3.6 3.7, 3.8
Pytho libraries does not work well with all versions like BERT, PyText 
So from the betginning of python it has a concept call "PyEnv"

Which means whenever you are working  on a new project  you always create a dedicated Python evnrionment and install all the dependencies specific  for that project 


example:

RiskDataMLProject -> c:\RiskDataMlProjGitRepo\<pyenv>
source activate c:\RiskDataMlProjGitRepo\<pyenv> in the command line... then ehatever Python cod you execute will depend on this folder installed libraries 
For example you nee  BERT here
pip install bert -> this will install BERT inside  c:\RiskDataMlProjGitRepo\<pyenv>

FraudDataMLProject -> c:\FraudDataMlProjGitRepo\<pyenv>
You dont need BERT here but you Pytext 
pip install pytext -> this will install pytext inside c:\FraudDataMlProjGitRepo\<pyenv>


========================

requirements.txt 

Just like Java has pom.xml for every Java project, every Python project needs requirements.tt file (this is otpitonal)  in this you wil lmention all library names 

pip install -r requirements.txt 

above is the commad



=======================

Java has following web frameworks like Struts, Spring Web, JSP
similar to that

Python has following we bframeworks like Django, Flask

Flask is very light webight bmeaning it does not come with all web related capabilities -> mini-web-framework -< best used to make Ptyhon code acessinble via HTTP
it is not meant for returning HTML as response, it meanst of rreturing JSON as response -> best suited for making ML code available via HTTP 

Django has full fledge web capabilities like Database transactions, HTML response, this is best usited if you need any HTML + JSON based api 

In the industry generally people use Flask as backend ML API and Angular as the front end not Python based Web UI
Angular is different technology -> using Angular they make a call Falsk API which return sthe JSOn and show that json in HTML format

Above is for Machine learning => Flask is Rest API
